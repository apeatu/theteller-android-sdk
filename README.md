## Before you begin


## Requirements


The minimum supported SDK version is 15

## Adding it to your project


**Step 1.** Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

    allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}

**Step 2.** Add the dependency

    dependencies {
	     compile 'com.github.apeatu:theteller-android:1.0.27'
	}

**Step 3.** Add the required permission

Add the `READ_PHONE_PERMISSION` and `INTERNET` permissions to your android manifest

     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
     <uses-permission android:name="android.Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

> **REQUIRED PERMISSION**
> This library requires the **READ_PHONE_PERMISSION** to get the build number for fraud detection and flagging as recommended here https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids.html#i_abuse_detection_detecting_high_value_stolen_credentials

## Usage

###  1. Create a `thetellerManager` instance
Set the public key, private key and other required parameters. The `thetellerManager` accepts a mandatory instance of  the calling `Activity`

        new thetellerManager(activity).setAmount(amount)
                        .setCurrency(currency)
                        .setEmail(email)

                        .setNarration(narration)
                        .setPublicKey(apiKey)
                        .setSecretKey(secretKey)
                        .setTxRef(txRef)
                        .acceptCardPayments(boolean)
                        .acceptGHMobileMoneyPayments(boolean)
                        .onStagingEnv(boolean)
                        .allowSaveCardFeature(boolean)
                        .setMeta(List<Meta>)
                        .withTheme(styleId)
                        .initialize();

###  2. Handle the response
In the calling activity, override the `onActivityResult` method to receive the payment response as shown below

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        if (requestCode == thetellerConstants.theteller_REQUEST_CODE && data != null) {
            String reason = data.getStringExtra("response");
            if (resultCode == thetellerActivity.RESULT_SUCCESS) {
                Toast.makeText(this, "SUCCESS " + reason, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
            else if (resultCode == thetellerActivity.RESULT_ERROR) {
                Toast.makeText(this, "ERROR " + reason, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
            else if (resultCode == thetellerActivity.RESULT_CANCELLED) {
                Toast.makeText(this, "CANCELLED " + reason, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        }
        else {
            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        }
    }
The intent's `reason` object contains the raw JSON response from the theteller API. This can be parsed to retrieve any additional payment information needed.

###  3. Customize the look
You can apply a new look by changing the color of certain parts of the UI to highlight your brand colors

    <style name="DefaultTheme" parent="AppTheme.NoActionBar">
        <item name="colorPrimary">@color/colorPrimary</item>
        <item name="colorPrimaryDark">@color/colorPrimaryDark</item>
        <item name="colorAccent">@color/colorAccent</item>
        <item name="OTPButtonStyle">@style/otpBtnStyle</item>
        <item name="PayButtonStyle">@style/payBtnStyle</item>
        <item name="PinButtonStyle">@style/pinButtonStyle</item>
        <item name="OTPHeaderStyle">@style/otpHeaderStyle</item>
        <item name="TabLayoutStyle">@style/tabLayoutStyle</item>
        <item name="PinHeaderStyle">@style/pinHeaderStyle</item>
